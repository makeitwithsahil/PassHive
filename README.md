# PassHive - Your Secure Password Manager

**PassHive** is a password manager app that helps you securely store and manage your passwords. With features like saving, editing, and deleting passwords, PassHive keeps your login information organised and easily accessible.

## Features
- **Save Password**: Add a password with the website/app name, username, and password.
- **Edit Password**: Modify any saved password.
- **Delete Password**: Remove a saved password when you no longer need it.

## How it works
PassHive stores your passwords **locally on your browser**. This means that your passwords never leave your device. They are not sent to any server, making it a secure solution for keeping your sensitive data private.

## Important Disclaimer ⚠️
- **`Local Storage`**: Your passwords are saved **locally** in your browser’s storage. This means if you **clear your browser data**, your passwords will be lost. If you open PassHive in a **different browser**, your passwords won’t be available.

- **Future Updates**: In the future, I plan to add a **database** and a **user login system** to make storing passwords even safer.

> _**Note:** This app is designed for **personal use** and to help you manage passwords efficiently on your browser. For better security in the future, I will implement advanced features._ ✨
